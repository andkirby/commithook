Travis Continuous Integration status.

## Composer Installation

To install Composer you may follow the link https://getcomposer.org/download/. Just go to your PHP directory and follow the instructions therefrom. ([Composer Intro](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md))

Install composer package `andkirby/commithook` by command (you may put it into your global vendor directory):
```shell
$ composer require andkirby/commithook
```
### Set up via command line

This feature is available since v1.6.3. _(Simple install command `commithook-install` is available since v1.6.0 but it was removed in later versions.)_

#### `commithook install`: Generate files

**NOTE:** Since v1.6.6 you may run via **_alias_** command **`php commithook.php`**. It could be helpful if you have some global PHP version but would like to use another one to run PHP CommitHooks. (This problem faced on Windows with **XAMPP** and another PHP version) If you'll install PHP CommitHooks into your global PHP you shouldn't face this issue.

Before you start please be sure that shell can run files from `vendor/bin` directory ([read more](#set-up-composer-vendorbin-directory)). Or use absolute path `/path/to/vendor/bin/commithook`.

Go to your project root directory and install commithook files:
```shell
$ cd /d/home/my-project
$ commithook install
PHP CommitHook files have been created in 'd:/home/my-project/.git/hooks'.
```
Actually you may skip step of getting in a project directory.
Run `commithook install` anywhere and put path to your project:
```shell
$ cd /d/home
$ commithook install
Please set your root project directory [d:/home]: d:/home/my-project
PHP CommitHook files have been created in 'd:/home/my-project/.git/hooks'.
```
If system couldn't find path to your executable PHP file it will ask about it.

Since PHP 5.4 console should not ask your about PHP binary file. Anyway you may set up path to your PHP binary file.
Also you may set path your project/VCS root.
```shellÐ¿
$ commithook install --php-binary=d:/s/php/php.exe --project-dir=d:/home/my-project
```
Or short version:
```shell
$ commithook install -pd:/s/php/php.exe -dd:/home/my-project
```

NOTE: Tested on Windows. Feel free [to put](../../issues/new "Add a new issue") your faced issues on [the project issues page](../../issues "Issues").

##### Extra Options
`commithook install` has options.
Please take a look them via command `commithook install -h`.
```shell
$ commithook install -h
[...]
Options:
 --project-dir (-d)    Set path to project (VCS) root directory.
 --hook                Set specific hook file to install.
 --commit-msg          Set 'commit-msg' hook file to install.
 --pre-commit          Set 'pre-commit' hook file to install.
 --overwrite (-w)      Overwrite exist hook files.
 --php-binary (-p)     Set path to PHP binary file.
[...]
```

#### `commithook remove`: Remove Hooks Files
To remove CommitHook files from your project you may use command:
```shell
$ commithook remove
```
Options list the same but without `--overwrite` and `--php-binary`.

#### Set up Composer vendor/bin directory
If you using GitBash or Unix system please be sure that your shell can find files in global vendor directory.
Or try to use absolute path `/path/to/vendor/bin/commithook`.
##### GitBash for Windows
You may don't have `vendor/bin` directory in global `PATH` environment variable.
For GitBash for Windows you can check this out:
```shell
$ echo $PATH | grep "vendor/bin"
```
If you got nothing try to add your `vendor/dir` path to your `~/.bashrc` file:
```shell
echo 'PATH=$PATH":/d/yourpath/to/php/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
and restart your shell.

## Set up GIT hooks manually

To set up GIT hooks you have to set up your commit-msg and pre-commit files.
If you placed commithook project into the same projects root directory and you
have just to copy such files from commithook directory into yourproject/.git/hooks.
In other cases please set up them manually.

Also you may use following template to create commit-msg and pre-commit files:
```php
#!/usr/bin/env /your/php
<?php
\$hookName = __FILE__;
require_once '/path/to/commithook/LibHooks/runner.php';
```

## Configuration

### How to use configuration layers

The system loads LibHooks/config.xml file at first.

#### Config caching
In then it will try to load cached file with full merged configuration by path:

- commithook/.cache/md5(version + directory of hookfile).xml

Cache will be invalidated if version was updated.

*NOTE:* In case you changed your local config files your need to clean up cache files.

#### Config layers
In such case it will merge all files in the XML node "additional_config". There are several default config XML files which will be loaded by default. So default files ordering is presented as this list below:
- commithook/LibHooks/config.xml (base configuration)
- commithook/LibHooks/commithook.xml (contains main part of configuration)
- commithook/LibHooks/commithook-magento.xml (contains configuration for magento projects)
- commithook/commithook-local.xml (it may contain your specific local configuration)
- HOME/.commithook.xml (the same but in user profile directory, the same `~/.commithook.xml`)
- PROJECT_DIR/commithook.xml (it may contain a project specific configuration which can be shared among your team)
- PROJECT_DIR/commithook-self.xml (it may contain a project specific configuration which shouldn't shared to your team)
The last one can be added into a project and might be used by all developers. PROJECT_DIR - is your project directory where from CommitHOOK has been run.

## Features
### Commit Message Validation
Default commit message format is:
```
[Commit verb] [Issue Key]: [Issue Summary]
[Commit Message]
```
E.g. for the bug:
```
Fixed PRJNM-256: An email validation doesn't work
 - Added missed email validator.
```
Where PNM-25 is an issue key of your tasks tracker.

There are available commit verbs:
- Implemented (for tasks)
- Fixed (for bugs)
- Refactored
- CR Change(s) ("changes" or "change", for applying code review changes)

*NOTE:* Actually this validation is hardcoded. It will be moved to configuration to be flexible later.

#### JIRA Integration
Since v1.6.10a an integration with JIRA issues tracker is available.
How it works?
At first you have to set up authorization to JIRA. All what we need: URL to JIRA, username, password.
Open file CommitHook XML configuration file:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<config>
    ...
    <jira>
        <url>http://jira.example.com</url>
        <username>my.name</username>
        <password>some-password</password>
    </jira>
    ...
</config>
```
If it's a global configuration you may place it in `~/.commithook.xml` (`%USERPROFILE%/.commithook.xml` for Windows, the path for GitBash).

##### Short Issue Commit
So, if you want to be ~~lazy~~ productive... :)
If you tired of copy-pasting issue key and summary that there is a good news.
If you'd like to speed up of writing commit-verb that there is a good news.
You may write it shortly:
```
F PRJNM-256
 - Added missed email validator.
```
The system will connect to JIRA and get an issue summary. Also it will recognize the commit-verb.
There are following short-names:
- `I` for `Implemented`
- `F` for `Fixed`
- `R` for `Refactored`
- `C` for `CR Changes`

Actually, you can be more ~~lazy~~ productive and avoid using project. Usually it's the one for all commits.
Please add following config in `PROJECT_DIR/commithook.xml` and commit to share with your team.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<config>
    <jira>
        <project>PRJNM</project>
    </jira>
</config>
```

Commit message can be more simpler:
```
F 256
 - Added missed email validator.
```

Please do not forget check issue numbers always!! It's just be more productive! ;)

###### Future Features
- Protect commits into issues with not appropriate status.
- Protect commits with verb Fixed/Implemented into issues Task/Bug (or auto set it).


### Skip Method Name Validation
To skip validation of methods name just add PHPDoc block tag @skipHookMethodNaming like following:

```php
    /**
     * My method
     *
     * @skipCommitHookMethodNaming myMethod
     */
    protected function myMethod()
    {
        //...
    }
```

### Skip Code Block Full Validation
Also you may skip validation fully for a particular code block:

```php
//@startSkipCommitHooks
$a=function($b){return $b};
//@finishSkipCommitHooks
```
